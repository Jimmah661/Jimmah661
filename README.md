I'm James

I'm a newbie web dev, hoping to build something that's going to change the world. 
I love building tools to make peoples lives easier, it's why I started learning how to code in the first place. 

I'm currently working on learning everything I can about the Drag and Drop API to create snappy and responsive user experiences. 

I'd love to colab with anyone who's open to teaching and learning and wants to help make things that make the world that little bit easier.
